*Project Title: Library Management System*

*Description*
The Library Management System is designed to manage the operations of a library, including tracking books, authors, members, and loan transactions. This system allows librarians to efficiently manage book inventories, member registrations, and the borrowing process.

*How to Run/Setup the Project*
1. *Install MySQL*: Ensure you have MySQL installed on your machine. You can download it from MySQL's official website • https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.
   
2. *Create a Database*: Open your MySQL command line or a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench and create a new database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE LibraryDB;
   USE LibraryDB;
   ```

3. *Import SQL File*: Save the provided SQL code in a file named `library_management_system.sql`. Then, import it into your database:
   ```sql
   SOURCE path/to/library_management_system.sql;
   ```

4. *Verify Tables*: After importing, you can verify that the tables have been created successfully by running:
   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

*Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)*
You can create an ERD using tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or MySQL Workbench. Here’s a link to a sample ERD for the Library Management System: Sample ERD • https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/.

*Repository Structure*
Your GitHub repository should include the following structure:

```
LibraryManagementSystem/
│
├── library_management_system.sql  # Well-commented SQL file
├── README.md                      # This README file
└── ERD.png                       # Screenshot of the ERD (if applicable)
```
